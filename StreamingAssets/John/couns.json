Just “looking” at it in your mind’s eye like you would a photograph is not enough. Visualization works best if you incorporate as many sensory details as possible. Enjoy the feeling of your worries drifting away as you slowly explore your restful place. When you are ready, gently open your eyes and come back to the present. Don’t worry if you sometimes zone out or lose track of where you are during a visualization session. This is normal. You may also experience feelings of heaviness in your limbs, muscle twitches, or yawning. Again, these are normal responses.",

If you find yourself falling into the trap of never knowing if what you’re doing is enough, it may help to have a talk with your supervisor and go over expectations, and strategies for meeting them. Stay organized, comfortable and confident about your position and role. Moreover, you should stay away from conflict and try to avoid perfectionist targets as much as multitargets that may increase the pressure on you without clear reason. Try to remember that work is not  life. Life is a bigger concept than either of us can accept or perceive. Try to remember to embrace this gift and protect it.",

Slowly tense the muscles in your right foot, squeezing as tightly as you can. Hold for a count of 10. Relax your foot. Focus on the tension flowing away and how your foot feels as it becomes limp and loose. Stay in this relaxed state for a moment, breathing deeply and slowly. Shift your attention to your left foot. Follow the same sequence of muscle tension and release. Move slowly up through your body, contracting and relaxing the different muscle groups.
